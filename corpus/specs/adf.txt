.ADF - ARTWORX DATA FORMAT                                              [7.2]

The .ADF specification is a essentially a single file which contains VGA font
data, the RGB registers for the text palette (registers 0-63), and an
unlimited amount of binary screen data.  It is intended primarily for
programmers who would like to add a unique look to any textmode program.

The control structure for the .ADF file is simple:

    BYTE                  : Version #
    Array of BYTES [192]  : Binary Palette Data in 3-byte triplets.  These
                            values correspond to the RGB data passed to
                            the VGA card.
    Array of BYTES [4096] : VGA Font Data.  Regardless of the screen mode, 
                            4096 bytes is written to the file.  This is the
                            binary data passed to the VGA card to generate
                            fonts.
    Array of BYTES [....] : (Unknown/Undefined Size) Screen Data.  This is
                            the actual screen data in the binary, two-byte
                            (character/attribute) format.  This data can
                            be directly copied to the screen and should not
                            go through the bios or console.
