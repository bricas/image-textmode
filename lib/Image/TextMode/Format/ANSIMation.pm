=head1 NAME

Image::TextMode::Format::ANSIMation - read and write ANSIMation files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ANSIMation is an pseudo-format whereby the ANSI is displayed at a slow
enough rate so that it appears to animate the image. This module simulates
this by assuming a C<position(0,0)> command is the start of a new "frame" in
the sequence.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( %args )

Creates a ANSIMation instance.

=head2 extensions( )

Returns an empty list.
